# END Risk Assessment System

Early Neurological Deterioration Risk Assessment System for Acute Ischemic Stroke

## Overview
This system is designed to assess the risk of early neurological deterioration (END) in patients with acute ischemic stroke. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide real-time risk evaluation based on key clinical indicators.

## Features
- Real-time risk assessment
- Multiple clinical indicator support
- User-friendly interface
- Instant results visualization
- Evidence-based prediction model

## Clinical Indicators
The system evaluates the following key parameters:
- NIHSS Score (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale)
- Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)
- Neutrophil Count (NEUT)
- Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)
- TOAST Classification (Large-Artery Atherosclerosis)
- Intracranial Arterial Stenosis (IAS)

## How to Use
1. Access the system through the provided URL
2. Input patient clinical indicators
3. Click "Calculate Risk Score"
4. Review the assessment results and risk prediction

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit (Web Framework)
- XGBoost (Machine Learning Model)
- Pandas (Data Processing)
- Scikit-learn (Model Support)
- Joblib (Model Loading)
