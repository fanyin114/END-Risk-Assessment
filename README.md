# END Risk Assessment System

Early Neurological Deterioration Risk Assessment System for Acute Ischemic Stroke

## Overview
The system is designed to assess the risk of early neurological deterioration (END) in patients with acute ischemic stroke following intravenous thrombolysis. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide real-time risk assessments based on key clinical indicators.

## Features
- Real-time risk assessment
- Multiple clinical indicator support
- User-friendly interface
- Instant results visualization
- Evidence-based prediction model

## Clinical Indicators
The system evaluates the following key parameters:
- NIHSS Score (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale)
- Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)
- Neutrophil Count (NEUT)
- Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)
- TOAST Classification (Large-Artery Atherosclerosis)
- Intracranial Arterial Stenosis (IAS)

## How to Use
1. Access the system through the provided URL
2. Input patient clinical indicators
3. Click "Calculate Risk Score"
4. Review the assessment results and risk prediction

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit (Web Framework)
- XGBoost (Machine Learning Model)
- Pandas (Data Processing)
- Scikit-learn (Model Support)
- Joblib (Model Loading)
